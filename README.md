# Legend-of-the-Five-Rings

## Overview

This project is a terminal-based game created in C++ called *Legend of the Five Rings*. The game is inspired by the traditional "Legend of the Five Rings" universe, and it involves various mechanics such as player choices, combat, and strategic decision-making. The game is designed to be played through the terminal, offering an immersive experience despite the text-based interface.

The game utilizes multiple C++ features, including object-oriented programming principles, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and file handling. It allows players to interact with different characters, engage in quests, and navigate through various storylines, all while relying on a set of rules governed by the Five Rings.
